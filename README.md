# Horiseon Refractor

## Description 

This activity is a chance to do some spring cleaning on someone else's already written code. My ultimate goal was to simplify the structure, use semantic html, and make sure everything functioned properly. I include various examples of work I did under usage.

## Usage 

I made a few changes to the sequential order to what seemed out of place to me.

Before:

After:

![After-01](./assets/images/Screenshot-01.png)

I turned the header into its own element tag. I was generally just trying to simplify the commands in Semantics to make the code easier to access with less class and div tags.

I also fixed an issue where the Search Engine Link was not going to coorect spot on the page so I added an id and class for their respective commands.

Ultimately, I tried to follow this diagram to the best of my ability
